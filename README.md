I am still in the planning stages of my thesis, which means lots of reading. You can view my reading list schedule [here](http://github.com/blatyo/Thesis/blob/master/Schedule.md).

I am also trying to get my project approved, so [here](http://github.com/blatyo/Thesis/blob/master/Preproposal.md) is the latest draft of my preproposal.
